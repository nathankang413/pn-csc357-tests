# Tests Cases for Asgn01
These are test cases for Assignment 1. If you are not working on Assignment 1, this probably isn't the place for you.

## Writing Test Cases
For this assignment, test cases should only be text files without any code. Tests can be run by comparing the output of the demo code (~pn-csc357/demos/detab or expand) with the output of your code. Thus, DO NOT add expected results to this directory, JUST test cases.
To add a test case, just create a file with the first 2 characters of your first and last name, with a test number: `phni-test01`
Any series of valid ascii characters should be a valid test case handled by both the demo code and our own programs.

## Using Test Cases
To use test cases in this directory, use IO redirection to pass them into your program. Then compare the output with a demo program.

Example from the given assignment file:
``` unix
% gcc -o detab -Wall detab.c
% ./detab < phni-test01 > detab.out
% ~pn-cs357/demos/detab < TestInput > reference.out
% diff detab.out reference.out
```

### Automatic testing
Perhaps I will write a test harness similar to `~pn-csc357/demos/tryAsgn1`, TBD.

## Verifying tests
Since any file with valid ascii characters should work for the demo programs, they should also work for our programs.
Thus, no verification should be necessary.
