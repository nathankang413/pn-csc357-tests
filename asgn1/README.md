# Tests Cases for Asgn01
These are test cases for Assignment 1. If you are not working on Assignment 1, this probably isn't the place for you.

## Writing Test Cases
- For this assignment, test cases should only be text files without any code. 
- DO NOT add expected results / solution files
- To add a test case, just create a file with the first 2 characters of your first and last name, with a test number: `phni-test01`
- Any series of valid ascii characters should be a valid test case handled by both the demo code and our own programs.

## Using Test Cases
To use test cases in this directory, use IO redirection to pass them into your program. Then compare the output with a demo program (~pn-csc357/demos/detab or expand).

Example from the given assignment file:
``` unix
% gcc -o detab -Wall detab.c
% ./detab < phni-test01 > detab.out
% ~pn-cs357/demos/detab < TestInput > reference.out
% diff detab.out reference.out
```

### Automatic testing
Perhaps I will write a test harness similar to `~pn-csc357/demos/tryAsgn1`, TBD.

## Verifying tests
Since any file with valid ascii characters should work for the demo programs, they should also work for our programs.
Thus, no verification should be necessary beyond successfully opening the file in a text editor.
